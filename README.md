# 2048-Expectimax
The classic 2048 game developed by Gabriele Cirulli recreated in pure Python with pygame with an Expectimax autosolver. (with smooth animations too :D)

## Features

- **Interactive Sliding Tiles**: Move tiles manually with the arrow keys.
- **Live Expectimax\* Solver**: Press "S" to let the solver predict the best moves, and watch it live!
- **Animated Moves**: Watch each tile slide smoothly and pop just like the original web game!
- **Easy Reset**: Press "R" to reset the grid again and reset your score
- **Customisable Depth**: Simply change the max depth in solver.py
